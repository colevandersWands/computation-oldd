a few more operators that are useful for the next step, but not too complicated
  !
    first define it on bools
    !a -> !Boolean(a)
    prove that !!a is equivalent to Boolean(a)
  ==
    if (typeof a === typeof b) {
      return a === b
    } else {
      ...
    }

  >, <, <=, >=
  -
    first define it's behavior on numbers only
    then factor in the type conversion to define it's behavior for other types
    -Number(a)
  +
    simply converts to number


write tests for them based on their composite definition
  putting together the proof cases from their primary operators
