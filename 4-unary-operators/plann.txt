using conditionals
	because at this point they can only use if/else (ternary, for collapsing)

incrementers will be difficult to fit in this template
	might have to treat them as binary operators
		the change, and the read
	or it only shows up in the log?

unaries
  test case & trace-blocks for unary operators
    implicit coercion?
  and some example of them in a computation string

  +
    if on a variable -> increments value, with coercion
    if on a primitive -> converts to number

  void is really one of these

  back-door coercions
    - isn't really, but can be thought of as unaries
    !!
    +, -
    ''+, ''-
